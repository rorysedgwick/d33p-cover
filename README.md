#Exploring d3 using the Bank of England public data sets

This project aims to use the Javascript data visualization library known as **D3** (*Data Driven Documents*)
to highlight some interesting trends or correlations found within public data sets released by the
Bank of England. The final visualzation will be entered into a competition being organised by the Bank
at the start of May.

It is primarily intended to be an week-long learning experience focusing on d3 methods and techniques,
Javascript data manipulation and data set formatting and preparation, as well as an exercise in project
planning and decision making. The finished project will then be be submitted on Friday in time for the
deadline of May 1st.

### To run this project yourself:
