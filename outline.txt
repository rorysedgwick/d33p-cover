# Progression of analysis - expand on qualification vs income to incorporate more detailed comparisons
    - how much is qual A worth more than qual B?
        - dependent on year/age?
    - income of men vs women with equal qualification
        - side by side comparative graphs
    - show relative numbers and ratios of people achieving each qualification, and how they have changed over time
        - age & qualification data is available but not the exact year of qualification

    - Check possibility of pulling average income data from range data points
        - May have to use mid-point averages again

# Graphical representation:
    - is column chart still best way to display data points?
    - line chart requires one axis to be time(?)

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Data needed from each dataset:

    +(ability to split by gender)
    qualifications:
        - total number for each qual
        - percent of total for each qual
        - average income for each qual group


    SOME OF THIS FUNCTIONALITY WILL MOST LIKEly BE DONE FROM WITHIN THE D3 DATA PLOTTING FUNCTIONS - work out which


# PLAN OF ATTACK:
 - data needs to be in format that d3 can read and can pull other associated data points - e.g. income for a certain qualification otherwise analysis is void.
 - Therefore values need to be stored in data type that allows links between data points. Object seems like obvious choice; store each person's answers in object and pick values needed for certain d3 elements? PRO: easy to add more values if extending comparisons is possible. Are object values allowed to be outcomes of operations of other object values? For averages etc.
 - Possibly use multiple arrays, difficulty being the data points would need to be indexed identically for each person otherwise data is invalid.
 - Array of objects, each containing data for single qualification i.e. 8 objects. All calculation therefore have to be done prior to inclusion in final data set.
